"This project was developed by a team of four members. My role was leading the front-end implementation, handling all HTML structure and CSS styling across the entire platform, and I was also one of the core contributors who helped establish and develop the original concept.
This project is a front-end based skills-assessment platform designed to simulate a real interview experience. The user takes multiple tests, and depending on the final score, the system either provides a job description or recommends suitable learning paths and courses."

In addition to its core idea, the platform includes multiple structured pages that guide the user through different assessment stages. Each test page contains clear questions, a scoring system, and dynamic navigation that leads the user to the appropriate result page based on their performance. The website also includes sections for contact, category-specific tests (such as HR, tourism, and technical roles), and an admin interface for reviewing details. The layout focuses on clean UI, consistent styling, and seamless transitions between pages to deliver an experience similar to an actual interview flow.
